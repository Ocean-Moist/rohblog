### These are my thoughts on zero sum games. From poker to quant trading. 

Zero-sum games are fundamentally informational contests. The theoretical optimal strategy is often suboptimal in practice because real advantage comes from information asymmetry and behavioral exploitation rather than mathematical perfection.

In markets, prices have no inherent meaning beyond what participants collectively assign through their actions. Value is constructed through narrative, liquidity, and behavioral dynamics rather than existing as an objective property. This poststructural nature means prices are ultimately functions of willingness to pay, intimated purely by available liquidity.

Success comes from identifying exploitable patterns in opponent behavior while concealing one's own patterns and intentions. The meta-game[1] becomes more important than object-level analysis. Technical patterns work not because they have inherent meaning, but because collective belief in them creates exploitable behavior.

Consider table image in poker: A player might intentionally play loose and aggressive with weak hands early in a session, creating a reputation for reckless behavior. This manufactured image leads opponents to call their large bets later when they actually hold strong hands. The initial losses are an investment in creating exploitable patterns in opponent behavior--they believe they've identified a pattern (reckless play) while missing the actual pattern. 

Another poker phenomenon is making looser calls earlier in the session, or when at an informationally disadvantage. You are paying for information, even if your equity is bad. You get to see their cards. 


Part 2 at some point putting this in context of more formal game theory/math.   

[1] You can get to "he thinks that I think that he thinks..." very easily. Here is some crass/terse advice: look him in the eyes, he either has it or he doesn't--the possible states collapse.
