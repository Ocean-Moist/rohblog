I’m Rohan. I’m 18, study CS at Purdue, and I’ve been building things since I was 9. Right now I’m focused on consumer AI under https://rhogpt.ai, and I’m raising a \\$25‑50k post‑money SAFE at a \\$4M cap (no discount).  

This post is for anyone considering backing me. It’s not a full business plan--just a window into who I am, what I’ve done, and how I think.

## the quick version

- I’ve shipped across **infra, ML, product, trading**, and more.
- I self-host all my stuff on my own hardware in a physical datacenter i've been patronizing for years. No AWS bills (yet).
- I’ve done everything from **building/selling Minecraft mods (where I started, 9-12)** → **flipping german cars (15-16)** → **building for Verizon (16-17)** → **trading the chess world championship using ML (18)** → **quant trading memecoins (18)** → **research making LLMs more efficient (dropping soon)**.
- My blog (this one) has had **30k+ readers**, with 10+ posts over 1k.
- I move fast, learn faster, and I’m obsessed with the edges of what’s possible. 

Right now, I’m building **AI-native consumer products**.

**People know AI will change their life [they just don't know how](https://rohan.ga/blog/ai_future/). I aim to show them.**


## what i’m building (now)

- **Kara** – an AI friend you can text like a real person. Not a chatbot, not a sycophant--just a distinct voice with memory, boundaries, and presence. Kara has 50+ beta users and is live now at [kara.rhogpt.ai](https://kara.rhogpt.ai) or via iMessage at +1 (650) 382-3244.

- **Rhoessay** – in progress. A structured writing tool built off my own internal workflow that can produce graduate level essays/long form content (>20pg) from scratch in under an hour. It decomposes the writing process (outline → gathering evidence → paragraphs → editing) and makes it interactive and transparent--not a magic GPT blob.

Both tools are part of the same thread: making agents that are **actually useful**, with **real interaction design**. I love curating UX. After these two are deployed, I plan to use this strategy:

 1. Take the AI I use in my everyday
 2. Put it behind a frontend 
 3. Distribute

Ex: if you email me there's a big chance an AI will respond, or at least tell me what your message is.

I’m using TikTok + Twitter to grow both. I’m learning distribution the same way I learned ML--fast, by doing.

## why i’m raising

I could go get a summer internship and play it safe.

But instead I want to go all-in. To do that, I need:
- Personal runway (SF isn’t cheap)
- Infra + API costs (Sonnet, Llama, etc)
- Maybe some money to finetune kara if needed (GPU time)

\\$20–30k gets me everything I need to build, launch, iterate, and grow. That’s it. No big team, no overhead. Just focus.

## what's after

There is a bigger picture, these disparate products are **experiments that generate real signal**.

Everything I’m learning building Rhoessay and Kara is part of a bigger plan: building infra that lets *anyone* create and deploy personal AI agents. Think workflows, tools, memory, routing--the hard stuff.

But I’m not starting with a B2B pitch deck. I’m starting with users, product, distribution--and using that to backsolve into what needs to exist. 

## why me

1. I’m technical enough to build
2. I’m curious enough to learn what I don’t know.
3. I’m fast enough to make things happen before most people have picked a stack.

And I’ve already lived at least five different lives online: modder, hustler, quant, student, founder.

I can turn a small check into serious leverage and I’m building the kind of products and systems that will define how AI actually gets used.
