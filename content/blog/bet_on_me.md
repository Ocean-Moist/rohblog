I’m Rohan. I’m 18, study CS at Purdue, and I’ve been building things since I was 9. I’m raising a pre seed round because I need as much leverage as I can get to build the future. It's still early (idea stage) so the check size will be relatively small.

- I’ve shipped across **infra, ML, product, trading**, and more.
- I self-host all my stuff on my own hardware in a physical datacenter i've been patronizing for years. No AWS bills (yet).
- I’ve done everything from **building/selling Minecraft mods (where I started, 9-12)** → **flipping german cars (15-16)** → **building for Verizon (16-17)** → **trading the chess world championship using ML (18)** → **quant trading memecoins (18)** → **research making LLMs more efficient (dropping soon)**.
- My blog (this one) has had **30k+ readers**, with 10+ posts over 1k.

Right now, I’m building generation defining **AI-native consumer products**.

**People know AI will change their life [they just don't know how](https://rohan.ga/blog/ai_future/). I aim to show them.**
