# this is where i store all my ideas

i have been around just long enough to realize i have forgotten many good ideas

## who am i

1. someone who is self-deluded enough to think they have good ideas and technically savvy enough to self host my own blog (i.e half the internet in 1994). 

2. i am a programmer interested in [useless programming languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ&pp=ygUPaGFza2VsbCB1c2VsZXNz) (who actually wrote his own useless programming language). 

3. a math hobbyist interested in "useless" math, though a lot of "useless" math is applied to change the world a few years later (see: [group based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-based_cryptography) for one example). 

4. a hacker in the RMS free-as-in-speech way and not the i-am-going-to-social-engineer-you-with-terrible-opsec-and-go-to-prison kind of way
