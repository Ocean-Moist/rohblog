## who am i (no particular order)

1. i am a **programmer** interested in [useless programming languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ&pp=ygUPaGFza2VsbCB1c2VsZXNz) (who actually wrote his own useless programming language). 
2. a **math hobbyist** interested in "useless" math, though a lot of "useless" math is applied to change the world a few years later (see: [group based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-based_cryptography) for one example).     
3. **entrepreneur**, see [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-ganapavarapu-5115041ba/), [edtran](https://edtran.com), [neuraltap.ai](https://neuraltap.ai)
4. **hacker** at heart

(oh and i happen to be a high school senior @ [the athenian school](https://www.athenian.org/about))
