## funding 

I am currently working on consumer AI products (pre-PMF) and doing ML research (releasing research on making attention mechanisms more efficient and compressing model weights soon). I am also running out of money. I am looking for an angel check/grant. 

I am a polymath with experience in everything from:
- [self-hosting/physical infra](https://x.com/oceanmoist/status/1910788994247385450)
- [pl theory](https://rohan.ga/blog/rohlang3/)
- [linux/deploying systems](https://x.com/oceanmoist/status/1862384551991156819/photo/1)
- [web dev/SaaS](https://kara.rhogpt.ai)
- [writing/philosophy](https://rohan.ga) (this blog has been visited by well over 30k people with 10+ essays >1k visitors)
- [game theory/quant trading](https://rohan.ga/blog/zero_game/)
- and about a million other things. 

I can build or do just about anything. 

If you want to know more about my experience or are interested please email me: rohanganapa@gmail.com.
